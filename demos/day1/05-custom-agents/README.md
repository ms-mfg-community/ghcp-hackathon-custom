# Day 1.5: Custom GitHub Copilot Agent Modes

## Objective

Learn how to configure custom agent modes for specific domains:
- Domain-specific agent configuration
- Building agents for specialized workflows
- Integration with custom tools and APIs
- Knowledge bases and context injection

## What You'll Learn

1. How custom agent modes extend Copilot capabilities
2. Domain-specific configurations (DevOps, Database, Security)
3. Adding custom knowledge and tools to agents
4. Building integrated development workflows
5. Use case examples and best practices

## Custom Agent Modes Covered

### 1. DevOps Agent
- Infrastructure-as-code generation
- Deployment automation
- Cloud resource management
- CI/CD pipeline creation

### 2. Database Agent
- Schema design and optimization
- Query generation and performance tuning
- Data migration assistance
- Database troubleshooting

### 3. Security Agent
- Vulnerability analysis
- Security code review
- Compliance checking
- Threat modeling assistance

### 4. API Developer Agent
- REST API design
- OpenAPI specification generation
- API endpoint implementation
- Integration patterns

## Demo Files

- `devops-agent-mode.py` - DevOps-specific agent workflows
- `database-agent-mode.sql` - Database agent demonstrations
- `security-agent-mode.py` - Security-focused agent patterns
- `agent-config.md` - Configuration guide

## Running the Demonstrations

In GitHub Copilot Chat, select custom agent modes and try these prompts:

**DevOps Mode:**
- "Generate a Terraform module for an Azure App Service"
- "Create a CI/CD pipeline for a .NET microservice"
- "Design a Kubernetes deployment with monitoring"

**Database Mode:**
- "Optimize this slow query [SQL]"
- "Design a normalized schema for [description]"
- "Generate migration scripts for [change]"

**Security Mode:**
- "Review this code for security vulnerabilities"
- "Generate OWASP Top 10 prevention patterns"
- "Check compliance with GDPR requirements"

## Key Benefits of Custom Agents

- ✅ Specialized knowledge and context
- ✅ Consistent patterns for domain
- ✅ Integration with domain tools
- ✅ Faster development in specific areas
- ✅ Better code quality through specialization
- ✅ Knowledge sharing across teams

## Best Practices

1. Start with clear domain boundaries
2. Maintain detailed context and knowledge bases
3. Regularly update domain-specific patterns
4. Combine multiple agent modes for complex projects
5. Document all custom configurations
6. Gather team feedback on agent outputs
